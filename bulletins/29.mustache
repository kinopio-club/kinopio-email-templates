<p>Hi friends, </p>

<p>Icy chill has graduated to mere wind and rain, which means it's probably spring, which means it's time for spring cleaning. </p>

<p>Starting a couple weeks ago, I paused making big new features in favor of fixing bugs and polishing details. There's lots of ambitious new interactions to come in the farther future â€“ but holistically speaking, Kinopio is a feature-packed tool with everything you need for working through ideas in creative and expressive ways.</p>

<p>We've got the communnity fabric, it's tightly knit and full of good feels. The technical foundation is solid and reliable. All that's left is to stitch all the pieces together.</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>Because of the focus on polish and fixes, I thought you might be interested in details. It's a lot though, so feel free to skip it.</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Increased the window size of the Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browser extensions for easier text entry</li>
<li>Simplified the export and import dialogs for downloading space JSON files</li>
<li>Reduced the amount of list re-shuffling that happens on your spaces list after it's loaded, to prevent misclicks</li>
<li>Increased the speed of creating a new journal space when weather is active</li>
<li>Increased the speed of opening your spaces list (especially noticeable on mobile and if you have a lot of spaces)</li>
<li>Clearer UI for adding background tint color</li>
<li>For improved performance while dragging items, connection line animations and video playback pauses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixes</h2>
