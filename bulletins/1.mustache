    Hello from sunny winter San Diego. Although I have to go back to Canada soon... for now though, the moisture, sunlight, and fresh air is really healing me.

    <!-- ðŸ›¶ -->
    In the last two weeks, I've been working on <a href="https://club.kinopio.club/t/strategy-letter-closing-the-loop/174/14">closing the loop</a> by adding comments and notifications to make it easier to follow activity and have conversations in spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="badge info">Upcoming</span>
  </p>
    <!-- ðŸ›¶ -->
  <p>
    I'll continue to close the loop in more ways, like by letting you know when your favorited spaces have been updated.
  </p>
  <p>
    ðŸ’° To help grow Kinopio to financial sustainability, sometime in the next month I'll be increasing the cost of upgrading your account to $5/mo, and also adding a $50/yr option. If you've already upgraded â€“ or if you upgrade soon â€“ you'll be grandfathered into the current price of $4/mo forever.
