    I'm back in Toronto and fortunately I still like snow. I've got a new mac and a very suburban winter view. Time for some good typing.

    I spent time on the little things that are more felt than seen. Fixed every bug reported on the <a href="https://club.kinopio.club">forum</a>, and improved the performance of moving cards by over 20%.

    ðŸ’° To help grow Kinopio to financial sustainability, in the next few weeks I'll be increasing the cost of upgrading your account to $5/mo, and also adding a $50/yr option. If you've already upgraded â€“ or if you upgrade soon â€“ you'll be grandfathered into the current price of $4/mo forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that, I'll be looking into more ways to make spaces feel social, but not distracting. And hopefully I'll also get to adding more <a href="https://club.kinopio.club/t/yearly-planner-grid-alignment-functions/187">card alignment options</a>.
