<p>Hi friends, </p>

<p>I get sick at least twice a year: when the seasons change from fall-to-winter, and from winter-to-spring. I canâ€™t imagine living somewhere without seasons, Iâ€™d be invincible. But for now, my nose is still snotty, and Iâ€™m hoping this bulletin will be coherent.</p>

</p>

<p>Over the last couple months, Iâ€™ve spent more time coding and less time writing â€“ basically the opposite of what you should do to grow and gain awareness for a new product. </p>

<p>Instead, I dug deep into the mines of improving stability, reliability and speed. So now the app is over twice as fast, and uses half as much memory. But software performance is hard to hype, because you feel it more than see it. </p>

<p>Maybe more crowd-pleasing is all the New Stuff listed below. Not just things people have asked for, but also what theyâ€™re likely to use regularly because it solves recurring problems for them.</p>

  <span>Relatedly, if you use Kinopio for work Iâ€™d love to know what kinds of tasks you use it for, and what you find most helpful about it. (You can reply to this email)</span>

<h2>Whatâ€™s New</h2>

<p>Details on new features and bug fixes have been moved from the <a href="https://blog.kinopio.club">blog</a> to the <a href="https://kinopio.club/changelog">Changelog space</a>. Adding cards is way easier than blog posts. The space is also easier to skim through, has more personality, and lets you add comment cards. </p>

<p>You can follow the Changelog, by â™¥ing the space to get email notifications when new cards are added, or subscribe to the <a href="https://api.kinopio.club/space/6lsytK8ZfOtMl2oqG05Rj/feed.json">RSS Feed</a>.</p>

<p class="badge secondary">(Even after leaving a lot out, this is going to be a long list of New Stuff)</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Groups</strong>. Keep spaces together and share them with the same set of people. Each Group member can see and edit all of the spaces in a Group. Use Groups for projects, teams, or like personal folders â€“ it's really up to you.</p>

<h2>Up Next</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ll be continuing to explore how Kinopio could best be used by teams. This will also involve learning more about how small businesses find and buy software. </p>

<p>Now that Iâ€™m out of the mines, Iâ€™ll hopefully be doing a lot more writing too. Including rewriting the help docs, and maybe publishing a user interview or guide.</p>

<p>Work has already begun on the much anticipated <a href="https://forum.kinopio.club/t/planning-card-lists-or-maybe-named-card-stacks/276">Lists</a>. According to the forums, weâ€™ve been discussing and planning this out since 2021. </p>

<p>Look forward to a new Producthunt launch, probably to be announced in the next bulletin. Kinopio originally launched as the #1 product of the week, itâ€™d be cool to do that again. (wink).</p>

<p>And â€¦ after iâ€™m finally done writing this bulletin iâ€™m going to clean out my fridge of all the weird foods and strange cheeses bought last month that I know I will never eat again.</p>
