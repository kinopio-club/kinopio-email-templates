  <p>New bulletin, new home. But this one (in Hoboken, NJ) looks like it‚Äôll stick.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs a weird feeling to be reunited with all your possessions after having them in storage for ~half a year. ‚ÄúI totally forgot I owned this‚Äù, ‚ÄúHuh, what‚Äôs this thing?‚Äù.</p>

  <p>But the most important part? My desk is back. Time for typing.</p>

  </p>

  <p>I‚Äôm in a sunny room. If I turn my head to the right, and walk a few steps, here‚Äôs the view outside my window.</p>

    üê¢ Sidenote: If I get reincarnated, I hope I come back as a turtle, carrying my house around with me wherever I go, just winning life.

  <p>
    For the first time in forever, I had almost two weeks of uninterrupted deep work time. So I typed and I drew:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new, more subtle, backgrounds</li>
    <li>Backgrounds can be personalized by color tinting them</li>
    <li>((Comments)) support images and audio</li>
    <li>Jump to spaces (cmd/ctrl-k)</li>
    <li>Search cards (cmd/ctrl-f)</li>
    <li>Added user pref to use last connection type/color</li>
    <li>You can now subscribe to <a href="https://pketh.org">the blog</a> by email</li>
  </ul>

    I got a lot done but I think I need to take a step back and do less typing and more thinking. Specifically, I need to focus more on getting Kinopio in front of more people. It‚Äôs a perennial challenge, I think they call it ‚Äòmarketing‚Äô.
  </p>
  <p>
I wrote a little bit more about that on <a href="https://club.kinopio.club/t/strategy-for-july-grooowth/339">the forum</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I‚Äôd love to know:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How did you find Kinopio?</li>
    <li>If you‚Äôve ever tried to describe it to someone else, what words did you use?</li>
    <li>Who is Kinopio good for? Who is it not good for?</li>
    <li>How should I promote Kinopio?</li>
  </ul>
